# Welcome to schema.b-ox.org!

Inspired by the work of [JSON for Linked Data](https://json-ld.org/) and [Schema.org](https://schema.org/) [we](https:///pending.schema.b-ox.org/page/about) build a **Semantic Data Model for Insurances**. As a **shared vocabulary** schema.b-ox.org makes it easier for API developers and website operators to get the maximum benefit from data. The data model is **open and free** for use. It might be used especially in the insurance industry or beyond. You can use it to provide APIs and websites with **insurance-related** meaning for better networking with other participants in the industry. Why? Because in the future everything's driven by [linked data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data). 

## Contribution

In this Github repository the source files for the official documentation of the Semantic Data Model are stored as JSON configuration files at [pending.schema.b-ox.org](https://pending.schema.b-ox.org) (production environment at schema.b-ox.org is still under construction). 

You can simply check the sources out and add new source files to expand the data model. You send us your extension as pull requests. The adjustments to the data model will be implemented quickly published after quality assurance at [pending.schema.b-ox.org](https://pending.schema.b-ox.org). After a while it will be published as an official release at schema.b-ox.org.

You can also [write issues](https://github.com/b-ox/schema.b-ox.org/issues) if you find error in the documentation or JSON-LD context files or if you are missing objects, attributes and enumerations in the model.
