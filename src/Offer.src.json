    "description": "An offer to transfer some rights to an item or to provide a service â€” for example, an offer to sell tickets to an event, to rent the DVD of a movie, to stream a TV show over the internet, to repair a motorcycle, or to loan a book. In the insurance industry typically an insurance company offers coverage in case of damage. An insurance policy (contract) is a confirmation (Order) of an offer. Note: As the BusinessFunction property, which identifies the form of offer (e.g. sell, lease, repair, dispose), defaults to http://purl.org/goodrelations/v1#Sell; an Offer without a defined BusinessFunction value can be assumed to be an offer to sell. In the insurance industry the default is http://purl.org/goodrelations/v1#ProvideService instead.",
