    "description": "If a property of any s4i object is missing, there is no real differentiation possible whether the object was just not provided by the data source or whether it is truly empty/non-existent. The None object serves to clarify that the given object/property is purposely empty. For example, if a Product uses a None object in its PriorDamage property, this indicates that the object has no prior damages as opposed to this information simply not being given. A None object can be inserted into any field without requiring the field to explicitly define defining it as allowed type.",
