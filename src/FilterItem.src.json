    "description": "A field in a filter describing a http://schema4i.org/Thing that must be matched by all results of the filter. The field can contain any partial Thing with a reduced number of properties. Specifically, the @type and @id field are not mandatory on all child objects, since their presence changes the semantics of the Filter. How exactly a FilterItem is matched against a Thing is determined by the http://schema4i.org/FilterType property of the Filter. Depending on the FilterType, it may be possible to add multiple FilterItems to a Filter, for example to describe an Or-Filter, an Exactly-One-Filter or in case of numeric fields to describe a range of values.",
